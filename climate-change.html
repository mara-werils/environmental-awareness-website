            <h2>Climate change is a global problem!</h2>
            <p>
                Climate change is a global problem facing our generation, 
                and it affects the entire planet. The main cause of climate c
                hange is human activity, especially greenhouse gas emissions 
                such as carbon dioxide (co₂), methane (ch₄) and nitrous oxide 
                (N₂O). These gases form a kind of "blanket" around the Earth, 
                trapping heat and causing an increase in the average global temperature.
            </p>
            <p>The consequences of climate change are already obvious:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Climate warming leads to melting glaciers and rising sea levels. It threatens coastal cities and island States.</li>
                <li>Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and destructive: hurricanes, floods, droughts and wildfires are damaging the natural environment and the economy.</li>
                <li>Ecosystem change and loss of biodiversity are occurring all over the world. Some species of animals and plants are facing extinction due to changes in their habitat.</li>
                <li>Problems of agriculture — Climate change affects yields and access to food, which can lead to hunger and lack of resources in different regions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>We need to save the PLANET</h2>
            <p>
                To slow down climate change, it is urgently necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
                This includes switching to renewable energy sources (solar, wind), improving energy efficiency, 
                protecting forests and reducing the use of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Climate change is not only an environmental, 
                but also a social problem that requires action at the global level. 
                The struggle for the future of the planet requires the efforts of each of us.
